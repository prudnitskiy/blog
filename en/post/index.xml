I did not even think I would work with colleagues, not from my country. As I more and more work with international companies I decided to switch my blog to a bilingual model. The plan is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>New articles would be published in both languages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old articles written in Russian would stay as it is&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Later I may translate some of them if they are not completely obsolete&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To keep data accessible I create rewrite rules so Google (hopefully) will not downrate my SERP position&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Not sure how it would work but let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
